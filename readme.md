This pet-project is a simple gui for mimetex.exe file
(the info link
https://www.mersenneforum.org/mimetex.htm
)

in two words mimetex.exe is used for representing math
it takes text arguments heavily based on LaTeX language 
and outputs a math formula gif image

requirements:
python 3.6+
windows only

doesn't work in "console off" mode for some reason :(
